The team has 2 members working on backend and two members working on front-end. in frontend Chetna and Ashutosh worked on the Ui/Ux of t[frontend](https://github.com/TechWhizKira/aristocat) website. In backend  Aryan and i was working on hive authentication first then we decided to divide the work Aryan worked on doing a simple authentication and I worked on the hive authentication but was not able to find the answers to my questions for me I wasn't able to understand the documentation. We tried our best from our side but we wasn't able complete the authentication so we went for the alternatives using reactjs and expressjs . But we had fun learning about the new blokchain technology.
We made a web application where a person can find a roommate including renting a room house or flat. For the user verification and authentication we were using hive authentication. In the end we had a lot of fun learning the new technology and going through the documentation but the documentation can be improved..
